# Brackets-XMPL-extension
This is an extension for Adobe Brackets HTML editor that provides right-click short cuts and code hinting for XMPie's XMPL server HTML attribute language.

1) Extends Brackets HTML code hints with Angular JS and XMPie's XMPL tag elements and attributes such as ng-show, xmp-show, xmp-image-asset, etc.

2) Adds right-click (context) menu items for inserting XMPie code snippets.

## Right-click code short cuts

Right-click to insert XMPL libraries, and other code sample snippets. See it in action:

## Languages

The menu in Brackets is customized for English as well as French and German. (Sorry, but only quick Google Translate that probably will need fixing. Happy for some extra help in this area if there are other willing contributors with other language experience.)
